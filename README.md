# Anemoia_Studios_Streamingapp
Creating a streaming service web app
As of Right now we are still developing locally and will be moving to depploy on vercel in the near future.

For now we have the Frontend of our app which is using Node.js and React components

https://nodejs.org/en/
please install Node.js 21.1.0 release

please create a branch and name the branch your name.
pull from main and clone the branch 
when running locally navigate the terminal directory to the Frontend folder for example it should look like this

then navigate 1 folder down to the Frontend

then assuming you already have node installed 

run:
npm install

(note that there are some warnings after you run install, for now we believe its outdated packages and we will resolve or remove these later on. There is no
negative impact currently to the running app so we have chosen to ignore the warnings for now.)

We have a package json file that has all packages needed to run the current build of the app already preset after you install all you need to do is 

run:
npm start

this should start the server and then post to local host 3000 and open your browser.

its live server so that when you make changes to code locally they should appear on the web page simultaniously and if errors appear you will recieve them in terminal as well as the browser.
